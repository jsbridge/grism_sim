# grism_sim
Grism simulations project

This is a tool for differentiating between emission star formation activity and active galactic nuclei (AGN) in high redshift galaxies using grism spectroscopy. In its current form, simulations are created to test the validity of the method.

What you will need:
Python (2.7 is best)
IDL
Main Python packages: SciPy, NumPy, Matplotlib, PyRAF, PyFITS, AstroPy

I'd recommend using the Python distribution from Ureka, as it includes many of the packages you'll need, particularly PyRAF, which can be finicky.

N.B. This is a work in progress.
