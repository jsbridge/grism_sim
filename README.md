# grism_sim
Grism simulations project

This is a tool for differentiating between emission star formation activity and active galactic nuclei (AGN) in high redshift galaxies using grism spectroscopy.

What you will need:
Python (2.7 is best)
IDL
Python packages: SciPy, NumPy, Matplotlib, PyRAF, PyFITS, AstroPy

I'd recommend using the Python distribution from Ureka, as it includes many of the packages you'll need, particularly PyRAF, which can be finicky.
